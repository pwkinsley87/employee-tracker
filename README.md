#employee-tracker

The purpose of this challenge was to use SQL and Node modules to build an employee-tracking app for the manager or owner of a small business. When the user runs the app in the terminal, they are presented with a list of choices: to view Departments, Roles and Employees, to add Departments, Roles or Employees, or to update a particular Employees' role. There is also an option to Depart the app. When the user selects to view Departments, Roles or Employees, they are presented with a table containing the relevant information. When the user selects adding a Department, Role or Employee, they are met with a series of prompts which collect the information necessary to populate the table. This app makes use of .sql and .js feelings, as well as a .json package and package-lock file for the .json data.
